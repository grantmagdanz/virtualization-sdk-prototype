# Classes

## DirectSource

Represents a Linked Source object and its properties when using a [Direct Linking](Glossary.md#direct-linking) strategy.

```python
from dlpx.virtualization.platform import DirectSource

direct_source = DirectSource(guid, connection, parameters)
```

### Fields

Field | Type | Description
----- | ---- | -----------
guid | String | Unique Identifier for the source.
connection | [RemoteConnection](#remoteconnection) | Connection for the source environment.
parameters | [LinkedSourceDefinition](Schemas_and_Autogenerated_Classes.md#linkedsourcedefinition-class) | User input as per the [LinkedSource Schema](Schemas_and_Autogenerated_Classes.md#linkedsourcedefinition-schema).

## StagedSource

Represents a Linked Source object and its properties when using a [Staged Linking](Glossary.md#staged-linking) strategy.

```python
from dlpx.virtualization.platform import StagedSource

staged_source = StagedSource(guid, source_connection, parameters, mount, staged_connection)
```

### Fields

Field | Type | Description
----- | ---- | -----------
guid | String | Unique Identifier for the source.
source_connection | [RemoteConnection](#remoteconnection) | Connection for the source environment.
parameters | [LinkedSourceDefinition](Schemas_and_Autogenerated_Classes.md#linkedsourcedefinition-class) | User input as per the [LinkedSource Schema](Schemas_and_Autogenerated_Classes.md#linkedsourcedefinition-schema).
mount | [Mount](#mount) | Mount point associated with the source.
staged_connection | [RemoteConnection](#remoteconnection) | Connection for the staging environment.

## VirtualSource

Represents a Virtual Source object and its properties.

```python
from dlpx.virtualization.platform import VirtualSource

virtual_source = VirtualSource(guid, connection, parameters, mounts)
```

### Fields

Field | Type | Description
----- | ---- | -----------
guid | String | Unique Identifier for the source.
connection | [RemoteConnection](#remoteconnection) | Connection for the source environment.
parameters | [VirtualSourceDefinition](Schemas_and_Autogenerated_Classes.md#virtualsourcedefinition-class) | User input as per the [VirtualSource Schema](Schemas_and_Autogenerated_Classes.md#virtualsourcedefinition-schema).
mounts | list[[Mount](#mount)] | Mount points associated with the source.

## RemoteConnection

Represents a connection to a source.

```python
from dlpx.virtualization.platform import RemoteConnection

connection = RemoteConnection(environment, user)
```

### Fields

Field | Type | Description
----- | ---- | -----------
environment | [RemoteEnvironment](#remoteenvironment) | Environment for the connection. Internal virtualization platform object.
user | [RemoteUser](#remoteuser) | User for the connection. Internal virtualization platform object.

## Status

An enum used to represent the state of a linked or virtual source and whether is functioning as expected.

```python
from dlpx.virtualization.platform import Status

status = Status.ACTIVE
```

### Values

Value | Description
----- | -----------
ACTIVE | Source is healthy and functioning as expected.
INACTIVE | Source is not functioning as expected.

## Mount

Represents a mount exported and mounted to a remote host.

```python
from dlpx.virtualization.platform import Mount

mount = Mount(environment, path)
```

### Fields

Field | Type | Description
----- | ---- | -----------
remote_environment | [RemoteEnvironment](#remoteenvironment) | Environment for the connection. Internal virtualization platform object.
mount_path | String | The path on the remote host that has the mounted data set.
shared_path | String | **Optional.** The path of the subdirectory of the data set to mount to the remote host.


## OwnershipSpecification

Represents how to set the onwership for a data set. This only applies to Unix Hosts.

```python
from dlpx.virtualization.platform import OwnershipSpecification

ownership_specification = OwnershipSpecification(uid, gid)
```

### Fields

Field | Type | Description
----- | ---- | -----------
uid | Integer | The user id to set the ownership of the data set to.
gid | Integer | The group id to set the ownership of the data set to.

## MountSpecification

Represents properties for the mount associated with an exported data set.

```python
from dlpx.virtualization.platform import MountSpecification

mount_specification = MountSpecification([mount], ownership_specification)
```

### Fields

Field | Type | Description
----- | ---- | -----------
mounts | list[[Mount](#mount)] | The list of mounts to export the data sets to.
ownership_specification | [OwnershipSpecification](#ownershipspecification) | **Optional.** Control the ownership attributes for the data set. It defaults to the environment user of the remote environment if it is not specified.

## SnapshotParametersDefinition

User provided parameters for the snapshot operation. It includes a boolean property named `resync` that can be used to indicate to the plugin whether or not to initiate a full ingestion of the dSource. The parameters are only be set during a manual snapshot. When using a sync policy `resync` defaults to `false`.

```python
from dlpx.virtualization.platform import Plugin

plugin = Plugin()

@plugin.linked.pre_snapshot()
def linked_pre_snapshot(staged_source, repository, source_config, snapshot_parameters):
  if snapshot_parameter.resync:
      print(snapshot_parameter.resync)
```

> This class will be generated during build and is located with the autogenerated classes. As it is passed into the operation, importing it is not neccessary.

### Fields

Field | Type | Description
----- | ---- | -----------
resync | Boolean | Determines if this snapshot should ingest the dSource from scratch.

## RemoteEnvironment

Represents a remote environment.
